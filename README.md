Baroness-Solitaire
==================

An implementation of the Baroness solitaire game. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroness_(solitaire) )

Two ```Solitaire.java``` classes exist in two different packages, ```basic```, and ```rules```. The basic ```Solitaire``` just plays the game, but with no rules. Once it's advised by the rules ```Solitaire```, the game will play with all the rules of Baroness enforced.
